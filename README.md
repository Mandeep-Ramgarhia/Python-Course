# 🎯 What is Programming
 
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. A computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence, we learn programming to instruct computers to do what we are very slow at—computation.
 
For example, if I ask you to calculate **`5 + 6`**, you will immediately say **`11`**. But what about **`23453453 x 56456`**? You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate it.
